There are two possible steps to resolve the problem.

1. If you have used an All-in-one BootCD that includes the plnode.txt file,
    then please check your machine for any old boot media, either in the
    floppy drive, or on a USB stick.  It is likely that an old configuration
    is being used instead of the new configuration stored on the BootCD.
Or, 
2. If you are using Generic BootCD image, then regenerate the node 
    configuration file by visiting:

    https://%(PLC_WWW_HOST)s:%(PLC_WWW_SSL_PORT)d/db/nodes/?id=%(node_id)d

    Under 'Download', follow the 'Download plnode.txt file for %(hostname)s'
    option, and save the downloaded file as plnode.txt on either a floppy 
    disk or a USB flash drive.  Be sure the 'Boot State' is set to 'Boot',
